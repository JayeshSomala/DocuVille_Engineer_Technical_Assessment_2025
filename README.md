# üß† Document Similarity Checker

## üëã Introduction
This is a solution to the **Software Engineer Technical Assessment [2025]** for Docuville.ai. The goal of the project is to build a system that can efficiently compare two large text documents and return a similarity score between 0 and 1.

## üöÄ Features

- Upload two `.txt` files via a modern UI
- Displays side-by-side comparison
- Highlights differences and similarities in color
- Shows a similarity score (0-1)
- Clean and responsive **dark mode** design
- Efficient backend using cosine similarity

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Run Locally

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/JayeshSomala/DocuVille_Engineer_Technical_Assessment_2025.git
cd DocuVille_Engineer_Technical_Assessment_2025
```
### 2. Start the Backend
```bash
cd doc-similarity-backend
node index.js
```
### 3. Start the Frontend

üß† Reflections & Future Improvements
Experience:
This was a rewarding challenge. It tested my ability to blend UI/UX, performance, and algorithm design.

If given more time:

Support for more formats (PDF, DOCX)

Caching frequent comparisons

Improving accuracy with NLP techniques (Spacy, BERT)

Authentication for user-level document history

Deploying on Vercel + Render or GCP with persistent logging
